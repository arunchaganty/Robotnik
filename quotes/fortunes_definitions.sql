Case n = k: Suppose you have a set of k+1 horses.  Pull one of these	horses out of the set, so that you have k horses.  Suppose that all	of these horses are the same color.  Now put back the horse that you	took out, and pull out a different one.  Suppose that all of the k	horses now in the set are the same color.  Then the set of k+1 horses	are all the same color.  We have k true => k+1 true; therefore all	horses are the same color.Theorem: All horses have an infinite number of legs.Proof (by intimidation):	Everyone would agree that all horses have an even number of legs.  It	is also well-known that horses have forelegs in front and two legs in	back.  4 + 2 = 6 legs, which is certainly an odd number of legs for a	horse to have!  Now the only number that is both even and odd is	infinity; therefore all horses have an infinite number of legs.
